    <h3>About Slemani</h3>
    <p>Sulaymaniyah, also called Slemani, also known as “City of Culture” is a city in the east of the Kurdistan Region, Iraq, not far from the Iran-Iraq border. It is surrounded by the Azmer Range, Goyija Range, and the Qaiwan Range in the northeast, Baranan Mountain in the south, and the Tasluja Hills in the west. The city has a semi-arid climate with very hot dry summers and cool wet winters</p>

    <h3>Slemani Economy</h3>
    <p>Slemani is known for its fertile land, and is surrounded by large plains that have historically produced the majority of wheat for Iraq. During the Ba’athist regime, targeted economic policies sought to reduce Sulaymaniyah’s economic viability because the city was a hub for Kurdish nationalism. After Saddam Hussein was removed from power in 2003, Slemani has seen a huge economic boom.</p>
    <h3>History of Sulaymaniyah</h3>
    <p>While economic and cultural activity in the Sulaymaniyah region can be traced back hundreds of years, the modern city of Sulaymaniyah was founded by a Kurdish prince in 1784.[1] The city has since grown to accommodate a population of over 1.5 million, and has a burgeoning economy that relies mainly on agriculture and tourism.[2] It is an important economic center for northern Iraq and has been named the cultural center for Sorani-speaking Kurds continuously since 1992.</p>
